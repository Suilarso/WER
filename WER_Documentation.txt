Bug report    
Mar 1, 22 - Product type and part list not re-display properly
Bug found on product type: For product selection from Coolant Pipe onward, will be saved into sql correctly, but will not be re-displayed correctly during search operation.
Severity status: major.
Root cause: the selection number return by listbox is a list of integer; but when saved to sql those numbers are translated into string without separator among different selections. For example: for selection of DPF and Coolant Pipe, the return integer will be 7, 10 but saved as 710 into sql; as such when it is retrieved back from sql, the 710 will be interpreted as item 7, 1, and 0 when in actual selection is 7 and 10.
Status: This bug is solved on Mar 3, 22

Mar 3, 22 - Date not refresh to current date after displaying a search record
Bug found on date field: When displaying a searched record, the date field will reflect the date when the record was created, which is correct in this case; but when the cancel button is clicked, the date field is not set to today date; as such the next new record to be created, the user will have to select today date from the calendar, which in this case is a bit inconvenient.
Severity status: minor.
